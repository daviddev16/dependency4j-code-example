It works with an Entity-Model, Service, Repository architecture with a nice Java UI design :)

services classes for their specific entities with instatiation/creation of dynamic and injectable classes and setting 
up configuration classes. The project also uses **SQLite** to store and data required to work locally, **Java Swing** 
for window building and design, **FlatLaf** library for theming and UI design, **Hibernate** to connect and interact
with the database and some other additional libraries such as **Lombok**, **JGoodies Forms** and **JDatePicker**.
